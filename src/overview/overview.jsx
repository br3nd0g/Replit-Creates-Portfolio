        <p id={"htText"}>Overall, I enjoyed the prompts. I learnt some cool things, like React & P5.Js. Half the days I had no clue what to make, resulting in rushed/bad creations, and at the time of writing this there are still 3/4 prompts I am yet to make something for, although the rest, were good, fun prompts. It took a lot of time, as a part of the month i was on holiday and for the last two weeks have been back at school, now that it's over, it's time for me to continue with all the projects I have planned :)</p>
